36 Oak & Barley	https://www.facebook.com/273370366063662	Set in the heart of Kemp’s  Corner, Mumbai, 36 Oak & Barley is dressed in a chic red wall, slick wood and brass  flooring with  hints of impactful accents: a stylish black jaguar  ready to leap at you from behind the Bar.  The vibe gets the better of you.    As you settle in and decide to order, you realize there's something in it for all. This all day dining space, offers a delectable menu  with a fresh perspective, its put gourmet into the simple dishes and made some of more complicated ones, very simple. The menu is a truly original concept especially since it offers comfort food , the basic and a bit more for some of the adventurous types.  The ethos is that each one should get what they want or simply, the next best thing and hence we don't have a specific cuisine. We take great pride in our simple dishes such as  the Akuri on  toast or a Chilli cheese toast with a twist.  You say take it to the next level and we say, Baked Asparagus & Cream Cheese Phyllo triangles with a Chive cream and cheese dip, or a local cheese fondue or or or the Shrimp and Calamari Ajillo with Ciabatta. You ask, but what about my waist ? And we say, hey, try the Salads or the Charcoal Grills or the Joggers Delight pizza or simply our yummy sandwiches in Brown bread. You say, but I don't feel like a sandwich, we say, well then try a Burger or a pasta. And you say, but I cant finish a burger, and we say, wait, there's 2 in a plate so you can mix and match and share.   Then you say, dazzle me, and we say Truffles with Macaroni and Cheese or the Ratatouille with Couscous or the Potato Rosti with Mushroom Fricassee for the veggies and Imported Basa Filet with Parsley Lemon Butter or the Barramundi Filet with Mustard Kasundi Cream for the non-veggies. YOU say U've had enough ... I need a break .. and we say, its then the Good old Custard and Jelly time.   These and all else on the menu have been perfected and served in a gourmet style with great emphasis being on not only the presentation and preparation but also on the freshness of ingredients used in each and every dish.   36 Oak & Barley boasts of a bar menu that fits all bills. Be it the tired mother in the day asking for a coffee to boost her spirit or a college student wanting to be adventurous and try a mocktail. In the evenings, the office employee wanting to soothe his nerves over a malt whiskey gets what he wants and so does his wife, her one glass of that International wine. Or the young neighborhood turk, trying the Anarkali Martini, recommended by the boyish bartenders. Oops, forgot to mention that famous Sangria that the young tourist is sipping whilst pouring over the internet connected to the free wi-fi offered.  You look around and you wonder, you may have as well been in New York. You need to calm your nerves, so maybe a cigarette may help. You turn to leave and voila, your gaze turns to a side alley, very subtly cleaned up, wherein you can smoke and not actually have to leave at all. A big advantage in today's hyper World.  But 36 Oak & Barley will keep pulling you back....

Nariman Point	https://www.facebook.com/112035015480221	Nariman Point is Mumbai's premier business district and country's first central business district. It was named after Khursheed Framji Nariman, a Parsi visionary. The area is situated on land reclaimed from the sea. It had the distinction of having the highest commercial real estate rental space in the world in 1995 at $175 per square foot ($1880/m²). Nariman Point hit a new high as a flat sold for a record $8.62 million (USD) on 26 November 2007, at an astonishing $2488 ( 97,842) per square foot.

The area is situated on the extreme southern tip of Marine Drive. It houses some of India's premier business headquarters. Nariman point is the 4th most expensive office market in the world.HistoryPrior to 1940, the area was part of the Arabian sea. A popular leader of the Congress, Khurshid Nariman (affectionately called Veer Nariman), a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation corporator, proposed to reclaim the area from the sea near Churchgate. To accomplish this task, debris from various parts of the city was dumped here and the shallow sea coast was filled. Reinforced concrete cement was used, of which the imported steel used was obtained from the black market at a higher price due to the World War II.The entire cost was estimated to be 3 lakhs or 300,000 (now 10 crores or 100,000,000) Additional reclamations were carried out in the 1970s. A construction boom in that decade saw this region spurting many commercial high-rises.

Marine Drive	https://www.facebook.com/172960992767405	Marine Drive is a skillfully laid-out boulevard in South Mumbai. It is actually an upturned 'C'-shaped six lane concrete road, which lengthens to 3 km along the coastline - a natural bay. This avenue connects Nariman Point with Malabar Hills. Situated over domesticated land, facing west-south-west, its coastline forms the part of the Arabian Sea. What draws attention to this avenue is the striking esplanade next to the road, where scores of people come to breathe fresh air and view sunset.   If you're feeling energetic, a stroll down Marine Drive is possibly the best way to discover Mumbai. This is a windswept promenade, flanked by the sea and a row of art deco buildings. Looped between the concrete jungle of Nariman Point, Mumbai's Manhattan, and the leafy green slopes of Malabar hill, Marine Drive was once called the queen's Necklace, strung with glittering street lights like an enormous strand of imperious jewels. It is also one of Mumbai's busiest roads, an important artery for the heavy suburban traffic heading downtown. Cars whiz continually past the two mile stretch, past huddled lovers, children and babies in perambulators. Like other seafronts, this is where most of south Mumbai comes to breathe in some fresh air.

Barista	https://www.facebook.com/111947212152831	A barista is a person, usually a coffee-house employee, who prepares and serves espresso-based coffee drinks.Etymology and declensionThe word barista is of Italian origin, and in Italian, a barista is a male or female "bartender", who typically works behind a counter, serving both hot drinks (such as espresso), and cold alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, not a coffee-maker specifically.The native plural in English is baristas, while in Italian the plural is baristi for masculine or mixed sex (baristi: "barmen", "bartenders") or bariste for feminine (bariste: "barmaids").Application of the titleWhile the title is not regulated, most coffee shops use the title to describe the preparer of coffee and operator of an espresso machine.Baristas generally operate a commercial espresso machine, and their role is preparing the shot and pulling the shot; the degree to which this is automated or done manually varies significantly, ranging from push-button operation to an involved manual process. Machines range from manual (lever), where the pressure is applied by hand, to semi-automatic, where the pressure is applied automatically but brew time is selected by the barista, to automatic, where the brew time is also preset (but preparing the grinds is still manual), to super-automatic, where the barista need only load the beans and push a button, but is otherwise completely automated. Espresso is a notoriously finicky beverage, and thus good manual espresso making is considered a skilled task. Further, preparation of other beverages, particularly milk-based drinks such as cappuccinos and lattes, but also non-espresso coffee such as drip or press pot, requires additional work and skill for effective frothing, pouring and most often latte art.

"Calma" All day Bar-Coffe shop	https://www.facebook.com/127538883975226	Το Calma All day Bar-Coffe shop προέκυψε από την, προ 7ετιάς, ανακαίνιση ενός άμεσα αναγνωρίσιμου χώρου, που αποτελούσε μια ολόκληρη στην ιστορία της Οιχαλίας, της καφετερίας Εναλλάξ. Το ανανεωμένο Calma Cafe είναι ένα όραμα και μία δημιουργία ενός ανθρώπου με μεράκι και πολυετή πείρα στον χώρο, του ιδιοκτήτη και υπεύθυνου του καταστήματος, Φώτη Χαλού.  Στην προσεγμένη διακόσμηση του καταστήματος κυρίαρχο ρόλο έχει το ξύλο, ενώ η χρήση γήινων χρωμάτων σε συνδυασμό με τον απαλό φωτισμό και... τις προσωπικές πινελιές του ιδιοκτήτη έχουν σαν αποτέλεσμα ο χώρος να αποπνέει μια θετική αύρα όπου ο πελάτης μπορεί να κάνει μία παύση από τους γρήγορους ρυθμούς της καθημερινής ζωής. Εδώ κανείς μπορεί να απολαύσει τον καφέ του από νωρίς το πρωί, να γευτεί ζεστά και κρύα σάντουιτς και να νιώσει την γλύκα του ολόφρεσκου γλυκού. Το βράδυ, μέσα σε ένα ζεστό και όμορφο περιβάλλον μπορεί κανείς να χαλαρώσει απολαμβάνοντας ένα ποτό ή ένα ποτήρι κρασί από την πλούσια κάβα του μαγαζιού ή προσωπικής παραγωγής του ιδιοκτήτη. Σήμα κατατεθέν του μαγαζιού είναι οι μουσικές επιλογές που σου δημιουργούν ένα αίσθημα χαλάρωσης και σε ταξιδεύουν. Επίσης εδώ μπορεί κανείς να σερφάρει στο Internet μέσω δωρεάν ασύρματου δικτύου καθώς και να παρακολουθήσει ποδοσφαιρικούς και όχι μόνο αγώνες στις μεγάλες οθόνες που είναι τοποθετημένες εκεί. Στα θετικά του καταστήματος και ενδεικτικό της άνεσης που προσφέρει ο χώρος είναι και το target group στο οποίο απευθύνεται, που αποτελείται από άτομα κάθε ηλικίας!

Starbucks Coffee	https://www.facebook.com/102173739824936	Starbucks Corporation is a global coffee company and coffeehouse chain based in Seattle, Washington. Starbucks is the largest coffeehouse company in the world, with 20,366 stores in 61 countries, including 13,123 in the United States, 1,299 in Canada, 977 in Japan, 793 in the United Kingdom, 732 in China, 473 in South Korea, 363 in Mexico, 282 in Taiwan, 204 in the Philippines, and 164 in Thailand.Starbucks sells hot and cold drinks, coffee beans, salads, hot and cold sandwiches, sweet pastries, snacks, and items such as mugs and tumblers. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and Hear Music brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also offered at grocery stores.From Starbucks' founding in 1971 in Seattle as a local coffee bean roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. The first store outside the United States or Canada opened in the mid-1990s, and overseas stores now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. The company planned to open a net of 900 new stores outside of the United States in 2009, but has announced 300 store closures in the United States since 2008.HistoryThe first Starbucks opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 30, 1971 by three partners: English teacher Jerry Baldwin, history teacher Zev Siegl, and writer Gordon Bowker. The three were inspired by coffee roasting entrepreneur Alfred Peet, whom they knew personally, to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. Originally the company was to be called Pequod after a whaling boat from Moby-Dick but this name was rejected by some of the co-founders. The company was instead named after the chief mate on the Pequod, Starbuck.

Στην αρχή οι αδελφοί Costa εργάζονταν ως παραγωγοί και χονδρέμποροι, προμηθεύοντας τα αριστοκρατικά εστιατόρια και τα εξειδικευμένα καταστήματα, ώσπου σύντομα έχτισαν την φήμη τους για την αφοσίωση τους στην άριστη ποιότητα του προϊόντος τους. Το 1978 αποφάσισαν να δημιουργήσουν το πρώτο  coffee boutique στην Vauxhall Bridge Road του Λονδίνου.  Η συγκεκριμένη ιδέα γνώρισε τεράστια επιτυχία, και ώθησε τους αδελφούς Costa στην επέκταση των coffee boutiques και στην ανάθεση της λειτουργίας τους σε Ιταλούς συγγενείς και φίλους. Από την ημέρα λειτουργίας του πρώτου καταστήματος μέχρι και σήμερα, χρησιμοποιείται η ίδια παραδοσιακή μέθοδος αργού καβουρντίσματος (18-22 λεπτά) των κόκκων καφέ, προσφέροντας το γευστικό και γεμάτο αρώματα χαρμάνι ‘’Mocha Italia’’, από 6 κόκκους Arabica και 1 Robusta.   Οι συγκεκριμένοι κόκκοι περνάνε άλλες 27 δοκιμασίες για να ειναι εγγυημένα οι πιο καλοί. Tο 100% του καφέ που χρησιμοποιείται για να φτιαχτεί το μοναδικό χαρμάνι ‘’Mocha Italia’’ προέρχεται απο παραγωγούς πιστοποιημένους απο την Rainforest Alliance.  Ψάχνουν να βρούν τον καφέ σε κάθε γωνιά της γής, όπου είναι πάντα εκεί ένας ειδικός για να διασφαλίσει οτι μόνο οι καλύτεροι κόκκοι καφέ θα φτάσουν στο φλυτζάνι σας. Ο Genaro Pellicia είναι ο Coffee Maestro των Costa. Κάθε παρτίδα περνάει πάντα απο αυτον έτσι ώστε εγγυάται η πραγματικά καλή ποιότητα. Η γλώσσα του μπορεί να ανιχνεύσει και την πιο μικρή ατέλεια, γι’αυτό ασφαλίστηκε απο την Lloyd’s για 10 εκατομμύρια στερλίνες!

Coon Chicken Inn	https://www.facebook.com/103815356323312	Coon Chicken Inn was an American chain of three restaurants founded by Maxon Lester Graham and Adelaide Burt in 1925, which prospered until the late 1950s. The restaurant's name (which uses an ethnic slur), trademarks, and entrances of the restaurants were designed to look like a smiling blackface caricature of an African-American porter. The smiling capped porter head also appeared on menus, dishes, and promotional items.The first Coon Chicken Inn was opened in suburban Salt Lake City, Utah in 1925. In 1929, another restaurant was opened in then-suburban Lake City near Seattle, Washington, and a third was opened in the Hollywood District of Portland, Oregon, in 1931. Later, a cabaret, orchestra, and catering were added to the Seattle and Salt Lake restaurants.The restaurant and themes were popular in their day and place. Today, Coon Chicken Inn items are part of the genre of racist art and black memorabilia. Memorabilia of the restaurant is collectible, and reproduction novelty items using Coon Chicken Inn logos are often available on Internet trade and auction sites.Seeing the changes in popular culture, the chain ended when the owners retired; keeping the real estate, they leased to other restaurateurs.

It's first appearance was at the 1998 Confest Festival near the NSW/VIC border on the Murray River.  The cafe operates at festivals, and specializes in creating a temporary space, full of people, music, laughter and love.  The backbone of the Cafe is the Tantric Turtle Gypsy Truck, a hand built caravan that rests on the back of an old Dodge truck.  In 2009 this truck was renovated and restored & the Tantric Turtle Cafe was re-launched, back in full force again.  Tantric Turtle Cafe is a family effort and every product sold is made with love and effort by members of the family. From hand crushing the spices for the Chai, to stirring the ingredients for the famous Brownies, a lot of effort goes into the products sold.  The Cafe operates at many festivals around NSW (& beyond). We have appeared at festivals such as  Peats Ridge Music Festival The National Folk Festival Playground Weekender High and Dry Festival Winter Magic Festival The Gumball Laneway Festival Subsonic Music Festival Foreshore Festival Lorien Novalis Market Day And many others.  The youngest member of the family is planning to open The Tantric Turtle Cafe in a permanent location in Sydney. He hopes to achieve this goal in the next few years & is already taking measures to ensure he succeeds when the time comes.

ABCTCL is one of India’s leading coffee exporters with clients across USA, Europe and Japan.LogoThe First Café Coffee Day logo a bright red cube with a green stroke above ‘e’ in ‘Café Coffee Day’. The word ‘Café’ was made to appear dominant to indicate Café Coffee Day’s introduction of ‘Café culture’ in India. The font used for ‘Café’ is called SLURRY – the font looks as though the letters have congealed or coagulated out of liquid. The current logo includes a dialogue box which highlights the connection between 'coffee' and 'conversations.' This logo also reflects their current tag line, "A lot can happen over coffee."The logo of CCD has been changed recently, this has been done in line with the increased competition and also for the proper conveying of the message that Café Coffee Day desires to tell to its customer. The famous Café Coffee Day squared logo has got a fresh new avatar – a ‘Dialogue Box’ - with the words Café Coffee Day written in a distinct, specially created font. The new trendy ‘dialogue’ logo symbolizes the essence of what a Café Coffee Day café is all really all about – a perfect place to ‘relax and dialogue.’ And as we all know, a lot does happen over coffee!Vertical integrationThe company is known for being vertically integrated to cut costs: from owning the plantations, growing the coffee, making the coffee machines to making the furniture for the outlets.The machines cost them 1.2 lakh each, which they say is half the cost of an imported coffee machine. The maintenance cost of CCD's machines is also less than foreign machines.

Về cua, có ba cách trình bày và chế biến. Một là bày nguyên con cua còn sống, còn dây ràng; hai là chặt làm 4 rồi xếp ra đĩa; cuối cùng là nấu chín rồi cho hẳn vào nồi nước dùng. Mỗi cách trình bày mang đến những trải nghiệm khác nhau về ấn tượng, cách thưởng thức.  Song nếu nói về độ hấp dẫn thì nồi lẩu với càng, mai cua "khủng", đỏ au, nổi bật trên màu xanh của các loại rau cùng hương thơm thoang thoảng trong gió luôn có sức hút mạnh hơn màu xám đậm hay vẻ "dơ dơ, bẩn bẩn" của những con cua còn nguyên dây ràng.  Minh chứng cho nhận định này là dù quán vỉa hè, giá 5 sao nhưng lẩu cua bể trên đường Nguyễn Thị Nghĩa luôn trong tình trạng “cháy vé”. Tất nhiên ngoài lý do bắt mắt thực khách từ ban đầu, không thể không tính đến điểm cộng về độ tươi, ngon, chắc ngọt của cua, cảm nhận đủ vị về nước lẩu của quán.
Indian Coffee House	https://www.facebook.com/111581462192178	The Indian Coffee House is a restaurant chain in India, run by a series of worker co-operative societies. It has strong presence across India. There are nearly 400 coffee houses all over India, which are a part of the chain.HistoryThe India Coffee House chain was started by the Coffee Cess Committee in 1936, when the first outlet was opened in Bombay. In the course of the 1940s there were nearly 50 Coffee Houses all over British India. Due to a change in the policy in the mid 1950s, the Board decided to close down the Coffee Houses. Encouraged by the communist leader A. K. Gopalan(AKG), the workers of the Coffee Board began a movement and compelled the Coffee Board to agree to handover the outlets to the workers who then formed Indian Coffee Workers' Co-operatives and renamed the network as Indian Coffee House. The first Indian Coffee Workers' Co-Operative Society was founded in Bangalore on 19 August 1957. The first Indian Coffee House was opened in New Delhi on 27 October 1957. Gradually, the Indian Coffee House chain expanded across the country, with branches in Pondicherry, Thrissur, Lucknow, Nagpur, Jabalpur, Mumbai, Kolkata, Tellicherry and Pune by the end of 1958. In Kerala there are two societies (Malabar and Travencore-Cochin area) formed.

Later Bellary and Madras (Chennai) Societies were separated from their mother societies.

Arsène Wenger	https://www.facebook.com/113098192037010	Arsène Wenger, OBE ( ; born 22 October 1949) is the manager of English Premier League side Arsenal. He is the club's longest serving manager and most successful, winning 11 individual honours since 1996. Journalists give Wenger credit for revolutionising football in England in the late 1990s, primarily through the introduction of changes in the training and diet of players, while attempting to implement a philosophy that football ought to be entertaining on the pitch.Wenger was born in Strasbourg, France and subsequently raised in Duttlenheim. He was introduced to football by his father, the manager of the local village team. After a modest playing career, making appearances for several amateur clubs, Wenger obtained a manager's diploma in 1981. His subsequent managerial career brought him greater triumph and recognition than he achieved as a player. Following an unsuccessful period at Nancy which culminated in his dismissal in 1987, Wenger won the league championship with Monaco in 1988. In 1991, he guided the club to victory in the Coupe de France, but failure to regain the domestic championship in later seasons led to Wenger departing Monaco by mutual consent in September 1994. He briefly coached Japanese J. League side Nagoya Grampus Eight, winning the Emperor's Cup and the Japanese Super Cup.

Three League titles, four FA Cups and four Charity/Community Shields have been amassed in his 11 years at the helm, including League and Cup ‘doubles’ in 1998 and 2002.  He is the only Gunners manager to have won the FA Cup more than once and the only manager to take the Club to a Champions League Final, while he was also the first manager in English league history to complete an entire 38-game season unbeaten in 2003/04.  Renowned as a cerebral, studious coach with a rare ability to spot and develop players from around the world, Arsène has had vital input into all areas affecting the first team — from the squad’s diet and training methods to the design of the first-team dressing room at Emirates Stadium.  His calm and measured demeanour is reflected by the style of his teams, which he sends out to play attacking and attractive football.  Arsène holds an economics degree from Strasbourg University and has also been awarded an honorary DSc by the University of Herfordshire. In 2002 he received France’s highest civil honour, the Legion d’Honneur, and was presented with an honorary OBE a year later. He was awarded the Freedom of Islington in 2004 and is fluent in five languages.  On September 7, 2007, Arsène signed a three year extension to his current contract, taking his tenure at the Club to June 2011.

Arsene Wenger needs to get Sacked	https://www.facebook.com/124749977601097	Since 2006 our manager has sold our best talent for mega money and refused to invest back into the team. His principles and penny pinching have resulted in a team full of poor players. We dream of signings like Kaka, Mata, Hazard.. But all we get is kids and unknown cheap players. We pay more money for tickets then any other fans in Europe. We were told the reason why we left Highbury was so we could compete with the big clubs in the transfer market. So why are we now selling our best players to our rivals?.... 1 man and 1 man alone is to blame, and he now has to be SACKED!!

Wenger	https://www.facebook.com/106268532737947	Wenger is one of two companies that have manufactured Swiss Army knives. Based in Delémont, Wenger was acquired by rival Victorinox in 2005.HistoryThe history of Wenger S.A. is strongly linked to the history of the Swiss Army knife.Company OriginsFounded 1893 at Courtetelle in the Delémont valley in the Canton of Jura the industrial cutlery house of Paul Boechat & Cie (the future Wenger) received a contract from the Swiss Army to produce knives as the second industrial cutlery manufacturer of Switzerland.In 1897 Theodore Wenger a minister who had served in the USA was returning home to Switzerland and was hired by the group of entrepreneurs that had bought the Boechat & Cie two years earlier, and later renamed the company Wenger et Cie..One of Wenger's first acts was to acquire a manufacturer of spoons and forks which he moved to a rented factory in Delemont. In 1900 a new facility was built. Both the utensil operations and the Courtetelle cutlery production were incorporated into the new plant now called Fabrique Suisse de Coutellerie et Services.In 1908 the Swiss Army decided to split the contract, with half of the order going to Victorinox, in the German-speaking canton of Schwyz, and the other half to Wenger in the French-speaking part of the canton of Bern.

Islamic view of Joseph	https://www.facebook.com/107947289228043	Yūsuf is an Islamic prophet mentioned in the Qur'an, the holy scripture of Islam. The figure corresponds to the character from the Jewish texts and the Christian Bible as Joseph and is the Arabic variant of that name. It is one of the common names in the Middle East and among Muslim nations.Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Jacob (Yaʿqūb), and his favorite. Of all of Jacob's children, Joseph was the one given the gift of prophecy. Although the narratives of other prophets are mentioned in various suras, the complete narrative of Joseph is given only in one sura, Yusuf. However, it is said to be the most detailed narrative in the Qur'an and bears more details than the Biblical counterpart. The story of Yusuf and Zulaikha (Potiphar's wife of the Old Testament) became a popular subject in Persian literature, where it became considerably elaborated over the centuries.

Liverpool	https://www.facebook.com/105653082800923	Liverpool is a city and metropolitan borough of Merseyside, England, United Kingdom along the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. It was founded as a borough in 1207 and was granted city status in 1880. It is the fourth most populous British city, and third most populous in England, with a 2011 population of 466,400 and is at the centre of a wider urban area, the Liverpool City Region, which has a population of around 2 million people.Historically a part of Lancashire, the urbanisation and expansion of Liverpool were both largely brought about by the city's status as a major port. By the 18th century, trade from the West Indies, Ireland and mainland Europe coupled with close links with the Atlantic Slave Trade furthered the economic expansion of Liverpool. By the early 19th century, 40% of the world's trade passed through Liverpool's docks, contributing to Liverpool's rise as a major city. Liverpool is also well known for its inventions and innovations, particularly in terms of infrastructure, transportation and general construction.

I <3 Basketball	https://www.facebook.com/239409293536	People don't play sports because its fun. Ask any athlete, most of them hate it, but they couldn't imagine their life with out it. Its part of them, the love/hate relationship. Its what they live for. They live for the practices, parties, cheers, long bus rides, invitationals, countless pairs of different types of shoes, water, Gatorade, & coaches you hate but appreciate. They live for the way it feels when they beat the other team, and knowing those two extra sprints they ran in practice were worth it. They live for the way they become a family with their team, they live for the countless songs they sing in their head while training all those hours. They live for the competition, they live for the friends, the practices, the memories, the pain, its who they are. It's who we are.

The population of Ireland is approximately 6.4 million.

Today, it is one of the most deforested areas in Europe. There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland.

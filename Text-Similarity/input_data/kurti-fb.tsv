Kurtis & Molly For ASB	https://www.facebook.com/393885273978132	Kurtis Cooper and Molly Olsen are a great pick for ASB President and Vice President. They look out for the student body as a whole, and would never leave anyone behind. We want MHS to be a place where everyone feels involved. We want all clubs and groups of MHS to be included in school activities. There are things such as Homecoming that we want to make amazing, and at the same time we want there to be more then just that. We have many great ideas to fill up the year with great fun. Assembly's we want to be something you look forward to, rather then want to skip. Speaking of fun we want to have dances all the time, instead of one every two months. Lastly Kurtis and Molly always will be looking for the next best thing to make your next school year the best, so vote for Kurtis Cooper and Molly Olsen for ASB Prez and VP.
